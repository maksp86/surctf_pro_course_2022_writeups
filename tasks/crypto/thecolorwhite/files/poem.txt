The Color White

Fair cloth and porcelain hearts
Twirling under a full midnight sun
And the house that we knew
Had come undone

Cracked wallpaper and ancient wood
Our footfall was all but an echo
Beaten down with the grey
And our faces were given to shadows

And I could see your gown of fallen tears;
The tattered color white.
It was your eyes that still understood sorrow
If my heart was perfect in your sight

I can feel everything
The fairest mind in red ardor
The framework of crashing hearts
Love, put on your armor

The dawn won't hold so kind
Our passion will not be similar and true
But it was always the white that made me humble
It was a deeper love that I knew
